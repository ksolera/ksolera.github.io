                    <li>Contrast: The contrast of this page uses the white space, the black menus, and font in a very effective way. It makes it easy to follow and does not crowed the page at all.
                        As different products are introduced, the colors change indicating a seperation for the reader. </li>
                    <li>Repetition: The font style and color are repeated throughtout the page. Links to additional product information are also repeated in style and color.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The alignment of the page is very central. The main products advertised are central. As you get lower on the page, sub-products have a dividing line down the middle in order to fit more products.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: There is a good amount of spacing between each element. This lets the reader know that there are seperate sections of content. It is very clear when and where these seperations happen.</li>
