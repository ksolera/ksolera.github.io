        <h3>What is M.E.T.A.?</h3>
        <p>M.E.T.A. stands for Mentoring , Encouraging, Talking, and Art</p>
        <p>Our mission is to mentor immigrant youth by encouraging them to speak up and talk to other people through various expressive form of arts.</p>
        <p>We serve first and second generation immigrant students enrolled in an ELL class</p>
        <p>We currently partner with North Mecklenburg High School, South Mecklenburg High School</p>

        <h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>(META at North Mecklenburg High School, 2015)  
            META started a college senior project in 2015 to see if implementing a mentorship with an art approach program would help ELL (English Language Learners) students acknowledge their acculturation process and use that awareness as energy to motivate them to be engaged in the classroom and learn English faster. The pilot workshop was done at North Mecklenburg High School and it was a success! The teacher saw immediate change of attitudes from some of her difficult and quiet students and their academic performance improved. Fast forwarding to today, META still focuses on helping youth acknowledge their heritage, honor where they are currently, and motivate them to pursue a goal.
