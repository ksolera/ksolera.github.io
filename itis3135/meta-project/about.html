        <h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>I was born in Ecuador and raised there until I was 13. My family moved to Charlotte, NC and have lived here ever since. I love to go on hikes, travel, and go to concerts! I have always had a passion for teaching, especifically others in needs.</p>
        <p>I started this Organization because many foreign born students did not have a proper program or introduction and would find themselves in difficult spots in school. I love to help others and is my passion.</p>
